# django-profile
 That is was a problem to someone he can't update his Profile, then Done !! I did it.

##  Note: 
I use Django signals to create a profile when you create a new user

##  install: 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:MrAhmedElsayed/django-profile.git

cd django-profile

virtualenv venv

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# login data:
Note that I have included the database with the repository, you do not have to do migrations again
##### first user:-
username: admin and password: admin

##### second user:-
username: ahmed and password: ahmed012732

press on "welcome, admin" to see your profile data and edit it.

Congratulations, you all Done
##### Best Wishes, Ahmed Elsayed Abd El-bari
